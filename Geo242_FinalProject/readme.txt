This folder contains the code for the GMT and Matlab sections of the final project for class. 

The GMT file makes a station map of the study area with Quaternary faults. 

The Matlab file takes a matrix of values and interpolates between points, using various methods, to smooth the grid. 

The data files required to run the code are not uploaded, due to size of the files.
